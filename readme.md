# yet another relog mod
a relog mod with a name so long, it's easier to just call it **yarm**


## features

* an aesthetic relog list design that follows my "perfection is bloated" design scheme

* clickable ui buttons that let you relog from the character list command (hint: click the rainbow [relog] in the character list)

* vanguard credit logging, letting you see at a glance if you have tikat waiting to be claimed

## commands
note that if you're using commands in the toolbox channel (`/8`), ignore the `!` prefix in the examples
also, you can use `yarm` instead of `relog` if you'd prefer

Command | Argument(s) | Example | Description
---|---|---|---
**!relog** | +, ++, nx | !relog +| logs onto the next character in the character list
**!relog** | -, --, pv | !relog -| logs onto the previous character in the character list
**!relog** | (name) | !relog character| logs onto the character name specified
**!relog** | (value) | !relog 6| logs onto the Nth character in the character list
**!relog** | none | !relog| lists your characters and vanguard credits, with clickable buttons if you're lazy
